# Metasploit Lab

This project sets up a Kali-based container (with Metasploit and PostgreSQL) and two vulnerable web apps (DVWA and Juice Shop) for hands-on security testing.

## Building the Docker Image

- Clone or download this repository.
- From the project root (where build.sh is located), run:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh --image <image:tag>
```

> If you skip the --image option, it defaults to metasploit:lab.

## Starting the Lab

1. Run:

```sh
./scripts/start_lab.sh --image <image:tag>
```

> If you skip the --image option, it defaults to metasploit:lab.


2. This will:

- Launch DVWA on host port 8080 (container port 80).
- Launch Juice Shop on host port 3000 (container port 3000).
- Spin up an interactive Kali shell with Metasploit ready to go.

3. When you exit the Kali container, the script automatically stops the DVWA and Juice Shop containers.

Thatâ€™s it! You should now be able to access the DVWA and Juice Shop sites in your browser and use the Kali container to run Metasploit or other tools.
